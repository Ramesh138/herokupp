MAP Concept :

HashMap Map m = new HashMap();

LinkedHashMap Map m = new LinkedHashMap();

Tree Map Map m = new TreeMap();

WeakHashMap Map m = new WeakHashMap();

Map is interface and Hashmap is a class that implements Map Interface

Map is the static type of map, while HashMap is the dynamic type of map

Main difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap is that LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order of keys, 
order in which keys are inserted in to LinkedHashMap



All three classes HashMap, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap implements java.util.Map interface, and represents mapping from unique key to values.

HashMap

A HashMap contains values based on the key.

It contains only unique elements.

It may have one null key and multiple null values.

It maintains no order.

public class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable

LinkedHashMap

A LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.
It contains only unique elements.
It may have one null key and multiple null values.
It is same as HashMap instead maintains insertion order. //See class deceleration below

public class LinkedHashMap<K,V> extends HashMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>

TreeMap

A TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
It contains only unique elements.
It cannot have null key but can have multiple null values.
It is same as HashMap instead maintains ascending order(Sorted using the natural order of its key.).

public class TreeMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements NavigableMap<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable

Hashtable

A Hashtable is an array of list. Each list is known as a bucket. The position of bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method. A Hashtable contains values based on the key.
It contains only unique elements.
It may have not have any null key or value.
It is synchronized.
It is a legacy class.

The difference is set is used to store only keys while map is used to store key value pairs.


Set contract says that it can not contain duplicates



 Duplicity: List allows duplicate elements. Any number of duplicate elements can be inserted into the list without affecting the same existing values and their indexes.
Set doesn’t allow duplicates. Set and all of the classes which implements Set interface should have unique elements.
Map stored the elements as key & value pair. Map doesn’t allow duplicate keys while it allows duplicate values.

) Null values: List allows any number of null values.
Set allows single null value at most.
Map can have single null key at most and any number of null values.
